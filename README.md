# UDSnipTex

After struggling to learn and write code from educational videos, I came up with a desktop tool that allows one to take a snip of the image and convert it into the text, which can be copied. It is an easy-to-use exe app with a cropping tool, to crop the image/video screen, along with the copy function to copy the text extracted from the cropped image.
